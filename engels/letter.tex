\opening{Dear Sir/Madam} 
 
\noindent 
I am writing this letter because your job opening for data center technician I saw at your website. 

\noindent
In the last four years I have managed several personal owned servers with different Linux and BSD distributions. Currently I am living in Rotterdam, however in the current months I will be moving to Groningen. Besides my ICT knowledge I have several years of experience with general electronics. During my study at the Rotterdam University I have done several extra projects and did teach a basic Linux class for different students. I am willing to follow any required trainings or qualifications.
 
I hope to have a personal interview with you about this job application, and I am in the next months in Groningen available for this interview.
 
\closing{Sincerely yours,}
